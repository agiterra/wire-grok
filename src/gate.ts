/**
 * TurnGate — serializes Wire events into codex turns.
 *
 * The app-server rejects turn/start while a turn is in flight (one active
 * turn per thread), so events that arrive mid-turn queue here and flush as
 * ONE batched turn when the active turn completes. Batching matters: a
 * burst of N channel events becomes one injection carrying all N, not N
 * sequential model turns.
 *
 * Pure state machine — no I/O — so the queue/batch semantics are unit-
 * testable without an app-server.
